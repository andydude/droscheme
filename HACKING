I've gotten it to compile without much functionality.

The process is as follows (also in Makeall.sh):

(1) make sure parse.go is built

    $ make -f parse.mk

(2) make sure the droscheme package is built

    $ make

(3) if all went well, then install it

    $ make install

(4) if all went well, then build the tools

    $ cd tools
    $ make

(5) if all went well, then it works!
