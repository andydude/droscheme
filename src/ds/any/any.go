// Interfaces
//
// These types are used for anything that supports them.
// 'any' is a synonym for Go interface{} objects, which 
// represents any object. Previously, the Any interface
// had Equaler and Hasher methods on it, which required
// that only user-defined types could become members,
// as time passed, it became clear that types such as
// bool or char or int32 or float64 should also be able
// to have Equaler and Hasher methods for them, and
// after realizing that this was impossible in the Go
// runtime, the requirement that every object implement
// Equaler and Hasher methods was relaxed.
