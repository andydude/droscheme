Droscheme documentation
=======================

cmd/
 * This is where command line tools are documented.
   Everything here is generated by Racket's scribble.

lib/
 * This is where Scheme libraries are documented.
   Everything here is generated by Racket's scribble.

pkg/
 * This is where Go packages are documented.
   Everything here is generated by Go's godoc.

The lib/ and pkg/ directories actually refer to the same
source code, but from different perspectives. The lib/
directory shows documentation from a Scheme perspective,
and the pkg/ directory shows documentation from a Go
perspective, which is mainly targeted at the "ds/any"
package, which provides some low-level functions that
may be useful in some hackery that may not work as
well from Scheme code. Most of the documentation that
is useful to Droscheme users will be in lib/.
