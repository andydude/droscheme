droscheme
=========

Droscheme - a Scheme implementation.

The goals of Droscheme are to provide a complete numerical tower,
a complete I/O port system including binary and textual ports,
and to experiment with nonstandard numbers and ports.

Documentation
=============
Droscheme is documented at [andydude.github.com/droscheme](http://andydude.github.com/droscheme/).

  * The [Commands section](http://andydude.github.com/droscheme/cmd/) 
    documents the commands used to interact with Droscheme. Many of the commands are available from the
    swiss-army tool **ds**. Some commands also have short names, such as **dsi** for the interpreter.

  * The [Libraries section](http://andydude.github.com/droscheme/lib/)
    documents the libraries from a Scheme perspective (in Scheme the term *module* is somewhat more common).
    These pages are generated by [Scribble](http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/), which requires Racket to build.
    All functions (in Scheme the term *procedure* is somewhat more common) are described along with their 
    contracts, constraints, and parameter types. References to RnRS and SRFIs are included whenever possible.

  * The [Packages section](http://andydude.github.com/droscheme/pkg/)
    documents the Go packages that implement the above libraries. These pages are generated by
    [Godoc](http://golang.org/cmd/godoc/), and thus include descriptions of all types and methods.

Dependancies
============

Droscheme requires Go. For an easy install process, Git is recommended.
For bootstrapping from sources, either Guile or Droscheme is required.

Easy Install
============

To install on Linux, run the command:

 wget https://raw.github.com/andydude/droscheme/master/web-install.sh --no-check-certificate -O - | bash -

To install on Mac OS X, run the command:

 curl https://raw.github.com/andydude/droscheme/master/web-install.sh -o - | bash -

Windows is not currently supported.

Manual Install
==============

You may install manually, but the process is more involved.
You have to download the sources, with git, .tar.gz, or zip,
and you can expand the directory whereever you want.

As long as you have $DROSCHEME_PATH set, it should work.
After the directory is expanded, make sure Go is installed,
and run

  $DROSCHEME_PATH/src-install.sh, 

which simply runs "go install" in every directory.
